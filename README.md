# Guidance#

A prototype repository for developing and testing guidance algorithms for the upcoming **KSA** (Kitten Space Agency).

## Overview

This project is currently focused on implementing the **Unified Powered Flight Guidance (UPFG)** algorithm.
The ultimate aim is to build a modular, extensible guidance system framework to support various flight phases in KSA — landing, rendezvous etc.
